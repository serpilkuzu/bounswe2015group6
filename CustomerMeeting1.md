### What is the main use by the user? ###

  * Take a diverse and distributed set of information and gather it together
  * Serial podcast: A young woman is murdered in 1999. Her ex boyfriend is convicted in 2000. Detectives think the case is closed, but the people are not satisfied. Crowdsourced crime solving. Elements inspected:
    * Nature of memory
    * Eye witnesses
    * Criminal system
    * Jury system
    * Jury selection
    * “Bad evidence” – you see what you want to see if you already have your mind made up
    * Forensic science (inspection of her injuries)
    * Brain science
    * Cell phone technology – one of the first cases that inspected cell phone data (who was called, when, which cell tower to find location)
  * We often compartmentalize what we know/learn, but there is a lot more influencing our thinking (historical events that happened at the same time in history are important, but we usually just focus on one war at a time – who won/why)
    * Simultaneous events influence the event
  * Fabricate an interrelated wider context to something
  * Want to see all pieces, and see the relationship between pieces
  * Maybe users navigate to page because they’re interested in mobile technology and they get linked to Serial
### Comments, feedback, discussion ###
  * Some will be helpful (interesting beneficial conversations), some will not (arguments based on biases instead of content, trying to troll/distort info)

### Will the system search the Internet to get content? ###
  * People will point to content
    * There’s a blog by this lawyer who says something about the forensic evidence in this section
  * Collective information space


### Will someone review or edit content? ###
  * They will be able to add content
  * Prefer that they be able to edit others posts if it’s done in a healthy way so that it’s like the information is constantly updating as opposed to a long thread of information
  * Posts and update posts are not great
  * Maybe versioning – versions are retained so you can track the history of the post
  * Ex: a map
    * No map
    * Map with a few things on it
    * More details on map

### Good search mechanism ###

  * Map of all information
    * Like Prezi
    * Nodes for different topics that get grouped together into central as people add to it and interconnect similar things
    * Nodes grow with connection and activity (comments, activity)
  * Users must register to contribute, not to view
  * Will there be a user profile?
    * Not initially
    * Depends on what content you add and interact with
    * Some profile information based – if you’re a chef, you should say so in your post about food and it will have more weight
  * How do you detect liars?
    * Someone claiming to be a professional who is not?
    * False content?
    * False tags?
    * Social process
    * Users will report it, then system will do something, as opposed to themes system detecting it


  * Domain of information -> interrelated concepts

  * Relating nodes should happen naturally – not user specified

  * You can link pages in your posts, but the content is not copied in

  * Look in Reddit Serial thread

  * Users will be tied to their comment or contribution or question or rating

  * Can call system Exploration Space

  * Can follow other users

  * Will there be a news feed? I don’t know

  * Completely social process – system does not search or add for content, only user generated

  * Requirements: system should do this, users should do this

  * User stories: which users in what capacity do what for what benefit
