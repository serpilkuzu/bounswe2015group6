# What is Semantic Tagging & Search? #

Semantic tagging means tagging for the semantic web. It can also be defined as the assigning of selected controlled vocabulary terms to content items to reflect the meaning of the content. This involves tags that make use of RDF(Resource Description Framework) specifications or OWL(Web Ontology Language) of the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C). This also implies being used for public webpages that can be accessed with semantic web browsers, rather than merely internal enterprise or library products or services.
That aim to improve accuracy of searching by understanding researcher intent and the contextual meaning of terms to generate more relevant results.


# How Semantic Tagging & Search Works #
  * Determine the meaning of documents:
    * Identify named entities and relationships
    * Categorize documents to taxonomies
    * Score each document with a “signature” or “graph”
  * Index the documents.
  * Determine the meaning of search terms.
  * Match documents to search terms via common meaning.

# Why Should I Pay Attention to Semantic Tagging & Search? #

Back in the days, the search engines just looked for the words in a page and showed the page when you search the keywords. However, this led to farm websites with thousands of keywords just to rank higher than anything else, but this wasn't a quality website.
So the search engines evolved, adding more and more to their algorithm in order to provide relevant results to the end-user.
And then, search engines added a new way for websites to tell what they are: semantic taggigng. When a spider sees a specific tag, it knows what it means. The word "meaning" has a lot of importance there.

# How to Take Full Advantage of Semantic Search #

  * **Create a Context**
> When you create a new content, try to present the information so it is easy for the user to find. When the user can easily understand your content, you have taken a big step in helping the search engines to do likewise.

  * **Synonyms and Variations**
> Besides enriching our text and make it more readable as it doesn’t repeat your keyword again and again, you will help search engines on two tasks you’ve seen that are very important:
    * Identify another set of terms that are directly related to the topic of our content.
    * Build a richer context for search engines.

  * **Semantic Keyword Research**
> Keywords are very important, so you must keep looking for those that offer you more benefit. With semantic search, you need to know how to find these profitable keywords that also benefit the context of your website.

  * **Link to Sources With Same Topics**
> When linking to external sites ensure that the content of these have as much or more quality than your own. You will strengthen the relationships between documents as well as providing more value to your users.

  * **Social Sharing**
> As you know high quality content is able to attract the attention of users and make them more inclined to share. Also, for certain social networks you also have a chance to mark up our content with metadata to improve the way they are displayed.

  * **Use Tools**
> There are many tools and resources you can use to give your content more semantic value. Among them:
    * [Schema.org](https://schema.org)
    * [Google Structured Data Testing Tool](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/)
    * [Yandex Cheker](https://webmaster.yandex.ru/microtest.xml)
    * [Structured Data Linter](http://linter.structured-data.org)
    * [Schema Creator](http://schema-creator.org)
    * [AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/demo/alchemylanguage)

# How Semantic Tagging Increases Findability #

> The web is like a pool that contains huge size of information. It is important to reach and select the right information. Findability is about how we can reach the information. As the findability of the information increases, we can get it more easily. Semantic tagging is also an efficient way to increase findability.It focuses on concepts rather than the documents as whole. In addition, it focuses on pieces of content at a finer, granular level rather than the documents as a whole.

> A simple taxonomy as used in information architecture with a hierarchy of category terms is not sufficient for effective categorization. It is needed to use a "thesaurus" style of taxonomy, whereby there is a cluster of synonyms or other equivalent terms(abbreviations, acronyms, spelling variations,grammatical variations, etc.) for each concept in the taxonomy.


# Key Benefits of Semantic Technology #

  * It creates an opportunity to tag standardization.
  * It is useful to make a site around the things people care and think about.
  * It connects the Semantic Web and Web 2.0 using semantic tags.
  * It connects Wikipedia and social bookmarking.
> > Social bookmarking is a centralized online service which enables users to add, annotate, edit, and share bookmarks of web documents.

  * It reutilizes RDF data available on the Web.
  * RDF provides a data model that is very flexible, enables interoperability and extensibility.
  * It provides auto-classification and multilingual semantic tagging.
  * It enables and facilitates communication between different services.

# Using Semantic Tags Correctly #

> You need to be careful that you don't use them incorrectly simply for their common display properties. Some of the most commonly misused semantic tags include:

  * **blockquote**
> > Some people use the `<blockquote>` tag for indenting text that is not a quotation. Use [CSS margins](http://webdesign.about.com/od/styleproperties/p/blspmargin.htm) instead.
  * **p**
> > There are a couple of web editors that use `<p>&nbsp;</p>` to add extra space between page elements, rather than defining actual paragraphs. Like with indenting, you should use the margin style property to add space.
  * **ul**
> > Like blockquote, enclosing text inside a `<ul>` tag will indent that text in most browsers. But this is both semantically incorrect, and invalid HTML, as only `<li>` tags are valid within a ul tag. Again, use the margin style to indent text.
  * **h1–h6**
> > The header tags can be used to make fonts bigger and bolder, but if the text is not a headline, it should not be inside a headline tag. Use the font-weight and font-size CSS properties instead.


> By using HTML tags that have meaning, you create pages that impart more information than by just surrounding everything with `<div>` tags. And by using semantic HTML tags, you are using tags with meanings.
