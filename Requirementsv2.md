# Requirements #
The system requirements are outlined below.
## Summary ##
The system is a web and Android crowdsourcing application that collects user-created information about a broad array of topics. Users who are interested in a specific topic can add new content, comment on existing posts, rate content, and view content. The system uses semantic tags to connect related topics into a web of information so that users can explore topics in a cohesive, non-compartmentalized manner.
