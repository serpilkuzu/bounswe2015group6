# What is crowdsourcing? #

Crowdsourcing is the process of receiving work or funding from a large group of people. Because crowdsourcing means _outsourcing_ work to a _crowd_, the words were combined to create the term _**crowdsourcing**_. Crowdsourcing comes in many different forms, as discussed below. The term was only coined and popularized in the last ten years. Crowdsourcing has become popular recently because the internet has allowed many people to be reached instantly. However, the idea of crowdsourcing has been around for much longer. For example, in 1714, the British government asked the general public to find a way to measure a ship's longitude. They offered money (under the name of the Longitude Prize) to the person with the best solution. In 1884, there was an call to the general public to submit English words and their definitions and example uses. After aggregating over 6 million submissions, the first version of the Oxford English Dictionary was created. Similarly, in 2001, Wikipedia was created as an open online encyclopedia. People around the world can create and edit Wikipedia pages.

# Different Types of Crowdsourcing #

While there isn't one single way to categorize the crowdsourcing landscape, there are common categories that are specified by industry experts and researchers. All of these categories fall under the term _crowdsourcing_.

### Crowdfunding ###

Crowdfunding involves asking a crowd of people to contribute money to your project. Individuals, businesses, and entrepreneurs can showcase their businesses and projects to people all over the world. If people want to support the project, they can donate to the cause. Many times people who donate to the project receive some compensation. For example, if you support an company who wants to produce a 3D printer, you may receive a company shirt or the 3D printer itself, depending on how much you donate. Crowdfunding profiles typically include a description, short video and images to introduce the project, a list of tiered rewards for donators to receive, and contributors to the project or a company description. For example, imagine you want to raise $10,000 to pay for studio time to record a new CD. You would find a crowdfunding platform and create a profile explaining the project. The profile would contain the monetary goal ($10,000), funding deadline, rewards for the donors (maybe a signed poster or the CD), and information about the project and yourself. You must raise 100% of your goal before the deadline, or all the donations are returned to the donors. Deadlines are typically less than 60 days. [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) and [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) are popular examples of crowdfunding websites.

### Crowdvoting ###

Crowdvoting is a way to gather a large group of people’s opinion on a certain topic. A company or a entrepreneur may crowdsource about a new product that isn’t released yet or collect new ideas to produce. Some of the most famous examples have made use of social media channels. Domino's Pizza, Coca Cola, Heineken and Sam Adams have crowdsourced ideas for a new pizza, Coca Cola bottle design, beer and song respectively.

### Crowd Wisdom ###

Crowd wisdom is the process of solving problems or gathering information by using the collective intelligence of a group of people, or the act of crowdsourcing information. A large group's aggregated answers to questions in fields such as quantity estimation, world knowledge, and spatial reasoning have generally been found to be as good as, and often better than, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group. Some examples of this category are [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), [Quora](http://www.quora.com/), [Yahoo! Answers](https://answers.yahoo.com/), [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/). Wikipedia is an encyclopedia where anyone can add or edit entries. Quora and Yahoo! Answers are both websites where anybody can ask or answer questions about any topic. These websites are considered "crowd wisdom" because they are a collection of information or wisdom created by a large group of people.

### Microwork (Microtask) ###

Microwork is a project that is broken down into small tasks which are completed by many people online. Microtasks are tasks that would be difficult for a computer to do efficiently or where human intelligence is required. Some examples of microtasks are translating text, transcribing audio clips, identifying pictures, or even bigger projects such as writing algorithms. People may choose to break their projects down into microwork when a human would be better at the task (such as with audio transcription), the task is too complex for a distributed system, to test Artificial Intelligence programs, or if the project is conveniently broken into small tasks. For example, imagine that you have 1,000 photos on your website that need captions. You could ask 1,000 individual people to add a caption and pay them .01¢ or .10¢ per photo. One benefit of microtasking is that you can expect to see results within minutes. [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) is the best known example of microwork. Amazon Mechanical Turk is a popular crowdsourcing platform that allows people to get paid to do simple tasks online.

### Macrowork (Macrotask) ###

Macrowork is a project that is broken into many tasks that each require unique skills or experience. Microwork and macrowork are very similar, except that macrowork requires specific skills for a given job and takes more time whereas microworks requires no specialized skills. Macrotasks may be part of specialized projects or may be part of a large, visible project where workers pitch in wherever they have the required skills. [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/) is a good example of macrowork.

# Pros and Cons of Crowdsourcing #

### Pros ###

  * Tasks can be completed for very little money
  * People from all over the world can come together to solve a problem or complete a task
  * There is no need to find, hire, and pay professionals
  * A high number of people can work on the project or help raise awareness or funds for it
  * It can easier for early-stage startups or people with project ideas to raise money through crowdfunding sites rather than through investors

### Cons ###

  * The job may not be done well because people who are not competent may contribute
  * By letting anybody work on the project, it becomes less credible and more risky to use the end product
  * It can be difficult for large groups of people to collaborate and work together productively
  * It can be difficult to manage a large group of people
  * People working on the project have no responsibility to finish it or do the job well

# Examples of Using Crowdsourcing #

There are lots of examples known as _crowdsourcing_. Some of them are indicated below.

[Anheuser-Busch(AB)](http://anheuser-busch.com/) – One of the world’s best brewers, AB has made sizable inroads in crowdsourcing.  While its Budweiser is easily America’s best-selling beer, AB looked for customer input to develop a brand more attuned to craft-beer tastes.  Development of Black Crown, a golden amber lager, combined a rivalry among company-brewmasters with consumer suggestions and tastings; this project had more than 25,000 consumer-collaborators.  In Brazil, where AB markets the leading brand, Skol, it has opened PopTent, a crowdsourced video-production company specializing in TV-commercials, utilizing a social network of 35,000 videographers from 120 countries.  AB’s site offers potential collaborators open innovation opportunities with the firm.

[Coca Cola](http://www.coca-cola.com/) – Coca-Cola uses a more open business model, assuming an increasingly noticeable position in corporate crowdsourcing.  Its open-sourced “Shaping a Better Future” challenge asks businesspersons to create improvement-ventures for the project-hubs of youth employment, education, environment and health.  Moreover, its “Where Will Happiness Strike Next?” series of short films and TV-commercials depend on on the social media-input of Coke customers, contributing ideas about creating happiness.  Coke also seeks crowdsourced online ideas and suggestions for marketing its products more effectively, once again tying social media to crowdsourcing.

[General Mills (GenMil)](http://www.generalmills.com/) – General Mills, major food-processing firm has created the General Mills Worldwide Innovation Network (G-WIN) to dynamically generate innovative concepts from crowdsourced partners in a diversity of merchandise, commodity, or service categories. The G-Win open call is sufficiently accommodating that anyone can go to the website, and click the “Submit a Novel Proposal“ tab to recommend product or technology innovation that is useful to GenMil and its businesses.

[Unilever](http://www.unilever.com/) - In spite of its globally-recognized and respected research staff and facilities, Unilever understands the value of partnership with innovative associates from outside the firm.  It seeks external contributions from anyone with beneficial input into such diverse project challenges as storing renewable energy, fighting viruses, reducing the quantity of sodium in food, creating cleaning-products that pollute less, and changing consumer behavior to encourage greater sustainability, between many other projects.  Unilever invites crowdsourced, open innovation submissions at its “Challenges and Wants:  Submit a technical solution to us via our Open Innovation“ portal.

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) - Wikipedia may be the pioneers of crowdsourcing. The not-for-profit Wikipedia Foundation launched its free, web-based, multilingual and collaborative encyclopedia in 2001.  It has over 17m articles written collaboratively by the community and is the most popular reference site on the internet.

More examples include:

  * [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
  * [Linux](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/)

Although the term "crowdsourcing" wasn't created until 2005 in a Wired Magazine article, and although crowdsourcing has been used within the last decade to refer to online activities, there are several examples of crowdsourcing from before the term was created. Here are some historical examples of crowdsourcing:

  * 1714 – The Longitude Prize: When the British government was trying to find a way to measure a ship’s longitude, they offered the public a monetary prize to whomever came up with the best solution.
  * 1783 – King Louis XVI offered an award to the person who could ‘make the alkali’ by decomposing sea salt by the ‘simplest and most economic method.
  * 1884 – Publication of the Oxford English Dictionary: 800 volunteers catalogued words to create the first fascicle of the OED.
